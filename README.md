Gonna play around a little with GIS data based on some interesting open datasets I found on electrification and population in Tanzania

# Where I got the data

### Electrification data
Downloaded a handful of datasets from the world bank site.

https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/tanzania-electricity-transmission-network-2014

Very small datasets, geoJSON format.

### Population data

https://africaopendata.org/dataset/zanzibar-population-density-2015

Very granular, pretty big dataset, geotiff format.

### District boundaries

https://energydata.info/dataset/tanzania-region-district-boundary-2012/resource/a9307b88-3e32-4e24-bcb6-25d2c2f3dd04?inner_span=True

Just a border reference, not sure how interesting it will be.


# Getting started

Probably start out with electrification data, and then once I get my feet wet layer in the population data.  Gonna start with python, since that's what I've been using a lot lately, and see how that goes.

Also, I found a cool open source tool at: http://electrification.energydata.info/presentation/

Should really look into that (havent checked yet whether its in Java or python.... or something else, we'll see).
